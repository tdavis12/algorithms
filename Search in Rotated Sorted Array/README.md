<h1>Search in Rotated Sorted Array</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
Input: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] and target=1, 
Output: 2.

<h3>Example 2:</h3>
Input: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] and target=0, 
Output: -1.

<h2>Challenge</h2>

O(logN) time.
